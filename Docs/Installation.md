# Installation

## 1. Pre-Installation
Follow the ArchWiki pre-installation steps until you have successfully booted into the live environment:
[ArchWiki: Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide)

## 2. Prepare Environment
```bash
loadkeys uk
iwctl --passphrase [password] station wlan0 connect [SSID]
```

## 3. Run Install Script
This modular script handles partitioning, formatting, package installation, and system configuration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not run this command via a pipe (`| zsh`) as it requires interactive user input. Use the process substitution method below.

```bash
zsh <(curl -Ls https://smplu.link/bYUs7)
```

### Script Workflow & Inputs

The script is interactive. Be ready to provide the following information when prompted:

1. **Secrets Decryption:**
   - The script attempts to download `setup_secrets.enc`. If found, you will be asked for the decryption password.
   - *Fallback:* If decryption fails or the file is missing, you must manually enter passwords (Root, User) and credentials (Git PAT) in the subsequent steps.

2. **User Configuration:**
   - **Hostname:** Defaults to `NCC-1701`.
   - **Username:** Defaults to `user`.
   - **Git Config:** Name, Email, and **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**.

     > [!NOTE]
     > A PAT is required to clone private dotfiles.

3. **Device Profile:**
   - Select **1** for Desktop (Ryzen 7800X3D / RX 7900 XT).
   - Select **2** for Laptop (Dell XPS 9550).

4. **Desktop Specifics (Profile 1 Only):**
   - **Media Drive:** You may enter a UUID to mount an existing media partition to `/mnt/Media`.
   - **Services:** All common media services (Arr stack, Transmission, Jellyfin) are configured automatically.
   - **Headless/EDID:** Option to inject a custom 2560x1600 EDID for headless streaming. You may need to specify the target port (e.g., `DP-1`).

5. **Disk Selection:**
   - The script lists available drives (e.g., `nvme0n1`).
   - **Warning:** The selected disk will be completely wiped. You must type `yes` to confirm execution.

## 4. Reboot
Once the script prints "System ready," reboot the machine:

```bash
reboot
```

> [!TIP]
> **First Boot:** Upon logging in, a terminal window will automatically launch to finalize setup (applying Konsave profiles, Sunshine configuration, and KWin rules). **Do not close this window** until it notifies you that setup is complete.
